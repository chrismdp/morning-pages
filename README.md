Morning Pages
=============

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/chrismdp/morning-pages.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/chrismdp/morning-pages)

I've long been fascinated by the morning pages habit of writing three pages (or about 750 words) of whatever comes into your head each day - it's like taking a mental showers and helps to clear your head, ready for the day. There are great sites out there like http://750words.com, but I live on the command line and like to keep my words on my own computer.

When installed, type `morning-pages` to open your `$EDITOR` with the file for today. Type away and quit your editor, and you'll get stats on how many words you've typed today.

Use `-d <folder>` to change the default words folder (currently `~/words`).

## Plans

In future, I hope to post words stats up to a central server so we can track leaderboards and badges. Don't worry, we'll never post your actual words.

##Â Contributing

We work on pull requests. If you have an idea for something you'd like to contribute, here's how to do it:

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
